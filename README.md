Pardio for Rdio
==========

NOTE: THIS PROJECT DOES NOT WORK AS RDIO HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN

rdio party vote system

This project is an implementation of a web based voting system using the Rdio player as an output. By relying on the web there are no dependcies on either the role of the manager of the system except bandwith or on the half of the voters with the exception of internet access. The system is being setup to be staged at pardio.malainey.com.
